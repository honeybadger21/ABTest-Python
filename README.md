# ABTest-Python

Let's imagine we are on the product team at a medium-sized online e-commerce business. The UX designer worked really hard on a new version of the product page, with the hope that it will lead to a higher conversion rate. The product manager (PM) told us that the current conversion rate is about 13% on average throughout the year, and that the team would be happy with an increase of 2%, meaning that the new design will be considered a success if it raises the conversion rate to 15%.

Steps invloved:
1. Designing our Experiment by formulating a hypothesis, choosing the variables, and choosing the sample size. 
2. Collection and Preparing the Data: Sampling from an existing A/B Test dataset. 
3. Visualizing the Results: Calculating the mean, standard deviation, and standard error for Treatment and Control groups.
4. Testing the Hypothesis: Calculating z-stat, p-value, and confidence interval. 
5. Drawing Conclusions
